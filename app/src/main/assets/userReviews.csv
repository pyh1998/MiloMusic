I keep listening to it over and over again. They really are the most beautiful songs in the world. My thanks to you, from Australia!
One of the most beautiful and amazing tracks I've heard. It really got my thinking and working. Beautiful, great great job.
Listening to this song, while going through pages and pages of your amazing blog just brighten up my Sunday morning. Thank you.
What a wonderful song, in such a lovely venue! Everything from the delightful through the spell-binding to the deeply moving. Your songs invariably surpass our already very high expectations.
Absolutely stunning!
Great passion and talent throughout. You convey emotion well.
Great musicianship, you play with confidence and vocally you have a really good tone.
It sickened and amused me at the same time.
Congratulations on assembling such a mind-boggling song of crap.
Vocally, you seem to have a booming voice and bags of potential and character in your tone.
Your voice is really noise, I don't like it at all!
You have lots of character to your vocal which really assists in delivering the story of the song.
You had a sultry delivery and a real strong commitment to the song and performance throughout.
Try to vary it more and give us more dynamics to the performance.
You probably need to look to work on developing your projection to be able to really climb into the song.
Your voice tunes the life of lifeless people.
You are the only person, who I want to listen till my last breathe.
Her voice has made my life musical.
Her voice is soothing to my ears.
Your voice is soulful.
When u sing it feels there is music in the air.
Your voice really moved me, its so honest and pure.
Your voice is not like that of the original singer. It creates a much more beautiful world that the singer's voice does.
You are the one due to whom I believe music never stays away and keeps manifesting itself in more beautiful forms that we can expect.
You are the definition of singer for me. You sound like (silence for half a second) maybe Heavenly music.
How do you manage to create so many worlds with just one voice?
You made my day :D
Your voice have its own charm which no one can own..you are such an original and a fantastic singer.
Whenever you sing, it feels as if sugar is being mixed Somewhere ..soon it'll turn me into a diabetic but still i won't stop adding sugar :D
Every song made me heave a burning sigh. Like a cough clears a throat, a sigh clears the heart. Thanks for making that happen.
This music bridges a gap between the artificial world and the natural world. You don't think man crafted when you think of this music, you think luxurious, powerful, organic humanity, but its sooo much deeper...
Music is moonlight in the gloomy night of life.
You have a lot of potential in the singing career, and I truly admire you.
It was a challenging song that most beginner singers prefer to stay away from.
The song you choose to present is quite different from your genre.
Your power and control over singing are just unbelievable.
You are a complete singer.
Wow, with this performance, you set yourself apart from other signers.
I like your voice, but I think you need to work on your stage presence.
Music is in your blood, and I find it quite inspiring.
I have never seen a gifted singer like you before. Your songs hit differently.
Our entire family is a big fan of your songs. We all listen to your songs every day.
You are an excellent person, along with a great performer.
We hope you won’t forget us if you become a successful singer one day.
You are practicing very hard; may you get everything you desire.
We are very proud that someone from our town has achieved such great success.
Looking forward to listening to your next song/album.
You’re an incredible singer.
You so inspire me. Everything I am right now is because of you.
You’re a fantastic singer, and there’s no exception to that.
